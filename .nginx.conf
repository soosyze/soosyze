# These types of files usually contain user preferences or the preserved

# example, the `.git` or `.svn` directories.
#
# The `/.well-known/` directory represents the standard (RFC 5785) path
# prefix for "well-known locations" (e.g.: `/.well-known/manifest.json`,
# `/.well-known/keybase.txt`), and therefore, access to its visible
# content should not be blocked.

# | Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks                       |
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# (1) Try to re-enable the cross-site scripting (XSS) filter built
#     into most web browsers.
#
#     The filter is usually enabled by default, but in some cases it
#     may be disabled by the user. However, in Internet Explorer for
#     example, it can be re-enabled just by sending the
#     `X-XSS-Protection` header with the value of `1`.
#
# (2) Prevent web browsers from rendering the web page if a potential
#     reflected (a.k.a non-persistent) XSS attack is detected by the
#     filter.
#
#     By default, if the filter is enabled and browsers detect a
#     reflected XSS attack, they will attempt to block the attack
#     by making the smallest possible modifications to the returned
#     web page.
#
#     Unfortunately, in some browsers (e.g.: Internet Explorer),
#     this default behavior may allow the XSS filter to be exploited,
#     thereby, it's better to inform browsers to prevent the rendering
#     of the page altogether, instead of attempting to modify it.
#
#     https://hackademix.net/2009/11/21/ies-xss-filter-creates-xss-vulnerabilities
#
# (!) Do not rely on the XSS filter to prevent XSS attacks! Ensure that
#     you are taking all possible measures to prevent XSS attacks, the
#     most obvious being: validating and sanitizing your website's inputs.

# Protect website against clickjacking.
#
# The example below sends the `X-Frame-Options` response header with
# the value `DENY`, informing browsers not to display the content of
# the web page in any frame.
#
# This might not be the best setting for everyone. You should read
# about the other two possible values the `X-Frame-Options` header
# field can have: `SAMEORIGIN` and `ALLOW-FROM`.
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034#section-2.1.
#
# Keep in mind that while you could send the `X-Frame-Options` header
# for all of your website’s pages, this has the potential downside that
# it forbids even non-malicious framing of your content (e.g.: when
# users visit your website using a Google Image Search results page).
#
# Nonetheless, you should ensure that you send the `X-Frame-Options`
# header for all pages that allow a user to make a state changing
# operation (e.g: pages that contain one-click purchase links, checkout
# or bank-transfer confirmation pages, pages that make permanent
# configuration changes, etc.).
#
# Sending the `X-Frame-Options` header can also protect your website
# against more than just clickjacking attacks:
